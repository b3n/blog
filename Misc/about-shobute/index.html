  </h2>
  <p><span class="logo">Shobute</span> is the blog of <a href="mailto:shobute2@gmail.com">Ben</a>, a computer science student from England.</p>
<p>The word &#8220;shobute&#8221; comes from the Japanese 勝負手, which is an all-or-nothing move in the game <a href="http://senseis.xmp.net/?WhatIsGo">Go</a>. It&rsquo;s the kind of risky play you have to make if you start to fall behind.</p>
<p>This blog is not inteded as an online diary, I will not be posting what I had for breakfast; instead I will post things which others (likely coming from Google) may find useful. There&rsquo;s no specific topic, posts may be about anything. The design is intentionally minimalistic, I want the focus to be the content.</p>
<p>Everything posted, unless explicitly stated in the post itself, is in the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">public domain</a>. You do not have to ask permission to copy/use/modify anything, you don&rsquo;t even have to attribute me. You can rip-off all my work and stick ads on it for all I care, it doesn&rsquo;t bother me in the slighest. Do what you like with it.</p>
<p>Unlike traditional blogs, posts on <span class="logo">Shobute</span> are not static, they are <em>all</em> considered a work-in-progress and thus may be modified or deleted at whim and without notice. There&rsquo;s no publish dates, only the latest update dates, which is what posts are sorted by. If you want to link to or reference a specific version of a post I suggest you upload it <a href="http://pastebin.com/">elsewhere</a>.</p>
<p>If you use a news-reader there&rsquo;s an Atom feed at <a href="/feed">/feed</a>. If your web browser does not support Unicode or modern HTML (<em>cough</em> IE <em>cough</em>) you&rsquo;re going to have a bad time.</p>
